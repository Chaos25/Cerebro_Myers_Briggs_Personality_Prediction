# PERSONALITY PREDICTION PROJECT 

## WHY WAS THIS PROJECT BUILT? <br />
The 21st century is fast-paced and unrelenting and mental health and its care tends to take a back seat as we hustle for a better future. Many times, we are unable to understand our inherent character traits and end up pushing ourselves to do what everyone else is doing, following the herd mentality and forgetting that human beings in fact are separate individuals with their own individuality that sets them apart from others.<br />
This Personality Prediction project was built to make the pursuit of finding your true self easier by giving you an accurate prediction of the major character traits you portray based on an extensive yet simple questionnaire. Not only will this help you understand your working habits, your decision making patterns, tenacity, etc. but also allow you to make the necessary changes in how you view yourself and be kinder to yourself.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is a personality predictor based on an existing database of more than 60 questions that calculate your personality prediction based on an extensive and simple to understand questionnaire. These questions have been referenced from the 16Personalities test website. (Link- https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test).<br />
Users will first have to make a login account with a username and password, so that their results can be stored in the database. There are no right or wrong answers in this case and the users’ answers only help in calculating the dominant traits exhibited by calculating a percentage.
    The charecter traits are based on the Myers–Briggs classification of personality.<br />
    These are: <br /> 
    1. Introvert / Extrovert (Energy)<br />
    2. Observant / Intuitive (Mind)<br />
    3. Thinking / Feeling (Nature)<br />
    4. Judging / Prospecting (Tactics)<br />

A counter is maintained to keep track of the selected answers so that we may be able to present our prediction when all the questions are answered and the percentages of each character trait is calculated using the code written in PL/SQL. <br />
