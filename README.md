#Personality Prediction Project
##Purpose
In today's fast-paced world, mental health often takes a back seat as we strive for success. This Personality Prediction project aims to help individuals better understand their character traits. By answering a set of questions, users can receive accurate predictions about their major personality traits. This self-discovery can lead to improved self-awareness and self-acceptance.

##About
This personality predictor utilizes a database of over 60 questions to calculate personality predictions. Users create an account to store their results, and there are no right or wrong answers—only a percentage calculation of dominant traits. Traits are based on the Myers–Briggs personality classification:

Introvert / Extrovert (Energy)
Observant / Intuitive (Mind)
Thinking / Feeling (Nature)
Judging / Prospecting (Tactics)
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, using an Oracle Database and PL/SQL for logic. The frontend is developed with React JS, styled using Bootstrap, and connected to the backend using Axios.
